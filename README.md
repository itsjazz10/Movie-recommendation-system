## **Project Title: Personalized Movie Recommendation System**

**Role:** Data Analyst

**Objective:** To develop a sophisticated movie recommendation system that accurately suggests personalized movie choices based on individual user preferences and viewing history.

**Key Responsibilities:**

1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning:**
   * Gathered and consolidated extensive datasets encompassing user profiles, movie metadata, and ratings information from diverse sources.
   * Employed SQL queries to cleanse and normalize the data, ensuring data quality and consistency for effective analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   * Extracted relevant features from user data and movie metadata, such as genres, actors, directors, and release dates.
   * Created additional features using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings to capture semantic similarities between movies.

3. **Model Development and Training:**
   * Implemented collaborative filtering algorithms (e.g., user-based, item-based) to recommend movies based on similarities between users or movies.
   * Explored content-based filtering approaches to suggest movies with similar attributes to the user's preferences.
   * Trained and evaluated various machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to identify the most effective recommendation strategy.

4. **Evaluation and Refinement:**
   * Assessed the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
   * Continuously refined the model by incorporating feedback and user interactions to improve accuracy and relevance.

**Technologies Used:**
* SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
* Machine Learning Algorithms (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)

**Achievements:**
* Developed a highly accurate movie recommendation system that significantly enhances user satisfaction and engagement.
* Successfully integrated the system into a web-based platform for easy accessibility.
* Demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and system implementation.
